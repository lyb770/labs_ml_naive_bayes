Tim Burton has commented that he wouldn't be caught dead reading a comic book.....and this movie (which is based on a comic book character)shows that. This movie and Burton's other batmans show his complete misunderstanding/ignorance of the whole Batman verse and his pathetic attempt to "Burtonize" it. It seems to him that near anyone can put on a costume and go from "regular Joe" to a caped crusader. Come to think of it, Burton described Bruce Wayne as a "regular guy" that becomes something else when he dons this costume. Bruce Wayne a regular guy??? He saw he parents murdered in front of him as a kid, rules an industry empire and is driven by his darker half to become a masked vigilante that swings from skyscrapers to fight crime. Tim Burton really, really needs to stick to his claymation type movies of weirdness because he has NO talent for an action movie & in-depth character like Batman. I pity Michael Keaton for getting stuck with a director like Burton for this movie.
