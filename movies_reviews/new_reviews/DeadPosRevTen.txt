If you like dry dark humor well this is your movie! Ryan is DP and always has been. If you don't get some of the jokes look them up because there are too many to list. I will say there is no comicbook charater more personified than Reynolds playing Deadpool! Hugh is close buuuut... Ryan takes it in the end! Yes there has yet to be something that is perfect in the viewers eyes but too me this is as close as one can get. The banter is one point and action is what one expects. Take all movies for what they are which is entertainment and this movie NAILED IT! Spoiler it has some violence and gore! C'est la vi! Don't be a wuss!
