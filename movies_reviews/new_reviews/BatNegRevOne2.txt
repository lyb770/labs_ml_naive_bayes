Was it comedy? It sure looked and sounded like it was attempting to be at times, but I never laughed, and I can laugh pretty easily when a movie is funny, even if that's unintended. Was it drama? I gained no sympathy for, or familiarity with any character. They were dull, meaningless and such unreal people. Was it horror? The special effects were impressive, but I felt no fear, nothing at all. And I mean NOTHING AT ALL!!! There was not one element of this movie that dragged me in. Kind of like just a boring commercial that's easy to forget. There were some good, seasoned actors in this movie, who I've enjoyed many times in other productions. I'm not even sure if saying 'miscast' is the right way for me to express my disgust. There was no script for them. Keaton is good for comedy and even drama at times, but he's no batman. Jack looks like The Shining repeated, in a boring way. Kim is like the cute girl that most guys with brains wouldn't want to be around. She looks like an irritation. I liked the old TV show, which is slapstick. And, I know that the comic books are more serious, which I don't mind. But this movie is DARK DARK AND DARKER. The last painful part of this movie that I'll mention is the music. It sounds like it would be good in some movies, but in this one it's just pure agony.
